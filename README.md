# pysus
A extremely simple &lightweight python static website generator.


# Simple introduction

Download the pysus.py file and put inside the folder, where you want your website to be.

Run the file ```python3 pysus.py``` and initialize the project, give it a name, author name and description.

After that your template website will be generated. You can add/remove posts from the posts.json file and you can also change the name/author name/description from the config.conf file.

To update the website after you made changes in ```config.conf``` or ```posts.json``` just run again ```python3 pysus.py``` and the new version of the website will be generated.


### Disclaimer
This is a really early concept / alpha version, I will work more on it, but for now its more a concept than a working prototype.
